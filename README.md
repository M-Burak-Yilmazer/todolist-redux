[Live Link ðŸš€](https://todolist-redux-mathias.netlify.app/)

In this tutorial , I  build a simple todo app using React and Redux Toolkit. Redux Toolkit is a powerful library that simplifies state management in Redux by providing utility functions and abstractions. 
I  use Redux Toolkit,  Framer-Motion for awesome animations and Method to sort and display lists and so CRUD operations.
